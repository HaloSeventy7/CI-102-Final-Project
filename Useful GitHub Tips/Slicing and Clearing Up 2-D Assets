Sometimes when downloading a 2-D asset/sprite pack, there will be a single image that contains many small images inside of it.
In order to split the images up into individuals, following the guidelines below:
Click on the image/asset
Figure out the size of the image and change the "Pixels Per Unit" to that size (i.e. a pixel character being 16x16 pixels should have a 
  size of 16)
Based on the size of the image/asset, check the "Override" checkbox below and change the size. This should be selected by whatever is 
  closest to the dimensions (i.e. an image is 900x400; select "1024." make sure to round up)
Click "Apply" to save changes
Now, click on the button that says "Sprite Editor," which opens a pop-up.
Select "Slice" at the top and make the x and y the dimensions of each individual image dimensions, such as 16 for x and 16 for y.
If the entire image/asset has a border, adjust the "padding" to the required size (i.e. border of 1 pixel should be a x and y padding of 1).
If there are a lot of small images to slice, the slicing may take a little while.
Make sure to click "Apply" at the top to save your changes. Then, exit out of the pop-up.
That's it! If you see the image/asset below, now when you click the opening arrow, you will see a bunch of individual usable images.

*Recommended!*
Try changing the setting on the image/asset for "Filter Mode." Change it from "Bilinear" to "Point (no filter)," as this reduces how blurry
  the individual images are.
  
  
Overall Moral: KNOW THE PIXEL DIMENSIONS FOR EACH IMAGE IN THE IMAGE/ASSET SET
