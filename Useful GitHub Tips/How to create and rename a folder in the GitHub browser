Creating:
Select "New File."
In the text field for the file name, write the name of the folder you want to create, then type "/" directly have the name.
Another text field will be created for you to name a file inside of the new folder, like this one.
Simply name the file and selected "Commit" at the bottom of the page.
Done.

After typing in the folder name, a file name is needed because GitHub doesn't store empty folders. A file must be created simultaneously.

Renaming:
Selected a file's naming textfield while in said file.
Type "Backspace" until the textfield of the folder name can be edited.
Rename the folder and type "/" once again.
Rename the file to whatever previous name or new name you had before.
Done.
